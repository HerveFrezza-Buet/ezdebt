# Installation onto a workspace.

Use (or create) a directory somewhere on your disk, that will be used
 as a workspace. Let us name here /home/myself/ezdebt-workspace that
 directory. We suppose in the following that it has been created
 (mkdir) previously.

Type the following to put the newly compiled version of ezdebt in that
workspace.

make WORKSPACE=/home/myself/ezdebt-workspace install

# Use of ezdebt

Go into your workspace

cd /home/myself/ezdebt-workspace

Create a .ezd file with a text editor, discribing a simulation. See
the examples provided for that purpose, as well as the vocabulary.ezd
file in the doc directory. Let us suppose in the following that you
have created a simu.ezd file.

Now, run the simulation

./ezdebt simu.ezd

And view the simu.html file with some web browser (firefox, ...)
